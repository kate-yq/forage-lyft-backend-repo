# Starter Repo

# Changes made
1. Delete all original engine classes, and merged them into 1 Engine class.
This class will take in engine type as a parameter to further decide which condition to use when calculating whether this engine needs service
2. Add a Battery class. 
This class will take in battery type as a parameter to further decide which condition to use when calculating whether this battery needs service
3. Add an init function in each model. 
Although the input formate is still the same, it set the engine and battery type in the body of init. If later on the battery/engine needs to change, only amend this part will be good enough.
